"""Vector geometry against the grid: filling, vertex mapping, canonical form.

Two ways to represent a vector feature, both described in section 4 of the
paper:

**Cell filling** - the feature is the set of cells it covers. Area follows
from a cell count with no projection distortion, but the index grows
verbose at fine resolutions.

**Vertex representation** - only the cells holding the polygon vertices are
kept, as in conventional vector data. Far more compact, and the form the
binary encodings in :mod:`itacart.serialization` are built on.

The descent
-----------

Filling never tests cells one by one. It projects the geometry onto the
parallels plane, shears the 45-degree tiling onto a square lattice exactly
as :mod:`itacart.cells` does, and walks the hierarchy: a node disjoint from
the geometry is dropped whole, a node wholly inside is accepted whole, and
only a node straddling the outline is subdivided. Cost therefore tracks the
outline, not the area.

The shear is the same one the quantizer uses, ``u = |x| + |y|`` and
``v = |y|``, applied per quadrant as a signed affine map so that the
mirrored quadrants keep their own handedness. Its Jacobian is 1, so a cell
count on the lattice is a cell count on the ellipsoid.

Scope
-----

Filling runs on the parallelogram interior and on the prime-meridian
column. The column holds triangles, not the sheared square the ordinary
descent tests, so it has a descent of its own: see
:func:`_fill_meridian_node`. Geometry reaching the last lattice column of
its row or the polar row is still refused rather than filled, because
there the cell is not the square either and no second descent replaces
it. See :func:`polyfill` for the exact predicate.

Provenance: ``itacart_core/cell_filling.py``, ``densification.py``,
``geometry_blob.py`` (``canonicalize_rings``) and
``cadastral_processor/vertex_extractor.py``. Two of the seven functions
have no counterpart there: ``cells_to_geometry`` is absent from all four
files, and the origin's filling implements one containment mode of the
three.

three bytes per cell, so two hundred million cells is a string of some

    clipping window and names no cell.

    The screen is applied at resolution 1 and is therefore conservative:
    a geometry inside base column 500 cannot reach a border-absorbing
    cell at any finer resolution, so refusing the whole base column
    refuses more than strictly necessary and never less.

    **Order matters.** The polar row is tested before the last column,
    because the polar row *is* a row whose only column is its last one:
    at resolution 1 it holds exactly one, so a last-column test placed
    first would answer every polar position with the wrong diagnosis and
    the polar branch would never be reached at all. Measured: the branch
    was unreachable until the two were swapped.

    Descends the hierarchy over the sinusoidal plane rather than testing
    cells one by one, so the cost tracks the boundary rather than the
    area.

    ``center`` keeps cells whose centre falls inside, ``intersects``
    keeps every cell touching the geometry, and ``contains`` keeps only
    cells wholly inside. The three nest, ``contains`` inside ``center``
    inside ``intersects``, and they nest by construction rather than by
    coincidence: see :func:`_accept_leaf`.

    **The centre, not the anchor.** A cell's anchor is a vertex and lies
    on its own border, so an anchor test would award a cell by a point it
    shares with three neighbours, and ``contains`` would stop being a
    subset of ``center`` for every cell whose anchor sits on the outline.
    The centre is interior to the cell and has neither problem.

    **Densification is applied, not assumed.** A straight edge on the
    plane is not a geodesic, so an undensified long edge fills the wrong
    cells in between and the result is a plausible, wrong cell set with
    no error raised. Areal input is therefore densified first, at the
    threshold :func:`_auto_segment` derives from the target resolution.
    Pass an already densified geometry and the step is idempotent.

    **The prime-meridian column.** Its cells are triangles straddling
    the line, so the ordinary descent cannot test them and a separate
    walk does. They carry the eastern spelling, which is the only one
    the grammar admits, and their containment is decided against the
    geometry before the quadrant split -- the one figure that sees both
    halves of a cell the split cuts in two.

    **Limitation, not a rule.** Two families are refused rather than
    filled: the last lattice column of a row, and the polar row. Neither
    cell is the sheared square the descent tests, and unlike the
    prime-meridian column neither has a descent of its own yet, so the
    fill refuses them.

    The cells exist. :func:`itacart.cells.geo_to_cell` names them,
    :mod:`itacart.boundary` builds their rings, and the hierarchy
    addresses their children; ITACaRT absorbs the border strip into the
    last column rather than dropping it. What is refused is the fill's
    ability to descend a trapezoid, and the refusal is stated here so
    that it is read as a gap in this function and not as a property of
    the grid -- which is what happened to the prime-meridian column,
    documented as a restriction for several phases before it turned out
    to need only a descent of its own.

    **Reopening trigger.** When the fill can descend a trapezoid, the
    absorbing cell stops being refused and starts being absorbed, and
    the screen loses the last-column family.

    Args:
        geometry: A Shapely geometry in EPSG:4326.
        resolution: Target resolution level, 1 to 13.
        containment: Predicate deciding whether a cell is kept.
        compact: Fold every node whose children were all kept, giving the
            same index as compacting the uniform fill afterwards with
            :func:`itacart.hierarchy.compact_cells` under the same
            containment mode. Returns a mixed-resolution index instead of a
            uniform one.
        n_jobs: Worker count; above 1 spreads base cells over threads.

    Returns:
        A compositional index string covering the geometry.

    Raises:
        AntemeridianError: If the geometry crosses 180 degrees outside an
            extension zone.
        UnsupportedGeometryTypeError: On unsupported geometry types.

    """Count the cells a polygon covers, without naming any of them.

    Fast path over :func:`polyfill` with ``containment="center"``: the
    count is accumulated during descent, so nothing is materialised and
    the call runs at resolution 13 where the index could not be built.

    Since every cell carries the same area, the count times
    :func:`itacart.resolutions.nominal_cell_area` gives a
    distortion-free area, which is the property the paper builds
    tokenization on.

    **Why the centre and not strict containment.** Counting only the
    cells wholly inside undercounts by the ring of cells the outline
    crosses, about ``perimeter * side / 2`` in area terms. For a
    square kilometre at resolution 7 that is two per cent. Under the
    centre rule the cells the outline crosses are kept or dropped
    according to which side their centre falls, and the two errors
    cancel to first order. The origin counts the same way.

    **What the residual error is, and what it is not.** The count is
    exact for every cell the outline does not cross, so the area it
    implies can only be wrong about the crossed ones:

    ``abs(n * a - A) / A <= P * s / A`` for perimeter ``P``, cell side
    ``s`` and area ``A``. That bound is arithmetic and holds for every
    parcel.

    Where inside the bound a given parcel lands is not predictable.
    Measured over 24 phases at each of seven parcel sizes, three
    estimators of the scaling exponent disagree outright: 0.61 from the
    RMS, -0.47 from the median, 0.00 from the ninetieth percentile.
    There is no power law to fit, because the residual depends on how
    that outline happens to sit against that lattice.

    This matters for how the resolution is chosen. It is not chosen from
    the parcel: in cadastral work it follows from the mapping scale and
    the positional tolerance the applicable standard attaches to it, and
    it is fixed before any parcel is measured. The parcel's size and
    perimeter then determine the residual, which is an outcome to be
    reported against the bound above, not a target to refine toward.

    **Limitation, not a rule.** The same two families :func:`polyfill`
    refuses are refused here, and it is the same gap: the count walks the
    squares the fill walks, so a family the fill cannot descend cannot be
    counted either. The prime-meridian column is counted by a walk of its
    own, and the other two await one. See :func:`polyfill` for why this
    is a property of the walk rather than of the grid.

    Provenance: ``itacart_core/cell_filling.py``

    Args:
        polygon: A Shapely polygon in EPSG:4326.

    The building block of :func:`densify_orthodromic`, exposed for

    The span is measured with the Vincenty inverse and the intermediate
    points are placed with the Vincenty direct along the forward azimuth,
    equally spaced in geodesic arc length. Nothing is measured on the
    plane, because the projection preserves area and not direction.

    ``n_segments = floor(d / max_segment_m) + 1``, so every resulting leg
    is strictly shorter than the threshold whenever any subdivision
    happens at all. That is what makes the operation idempotent: a second

    **Each interior point is put on the branch of the endpoint nearer to
    it in arc length**, the start for the first half and the destination
    for the second. On an ordinary segment the two references sit less
    than half a turn apart and agree, so the rule changes nothing. On a
    segment spanning exactly half a turn of longitude they do not agree,
    because such a segment is meridional: its geodesic passes through a
    pole and its longitude jumps a hundred and eighty degrees there.
    Referring the far half to the start would let it land on the opposite
    branch from the vertex it is walking towards, which folds the ring
    across the globe and leaves the projection with a self-intersection
    the caller cannot read. The midpoint itself, which is the pole when
    the segment is symmetric about it, is referred to the start; its
    longitude is immaterial because the parallels plane collapses every
    meridian at the pole onto one point.

    asked and the wrong one for densification. A segment written from
    179.9 to 180.3 -- the natural way to describe a footprint inside an
    extension zone, where the domain reaches past the antemeridian --
    has interior points at 180.1, and normalising those to -179.9 folds
    the ring back across the globe. The result self-intersects, and the

    Densification therefore keeps the branch the caller wrote. Segments
    that genuinely wrap are refused upstream by

    At exactly half a globe the branch is not unambiguous, and this

    joining them runs through the pole, and the longitude changes by a
    hundred and eighty degrees at the crossing. Both ``+180`` and
