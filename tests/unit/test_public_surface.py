"""The package's public contract, stated as an invariant rather than a list.

Four separate phases each noticed that some name declared public by a
module never reached the top of the package, and each of them wrote the
missing name into a note instead of into a check. A list of names goes
stale the moment a module gains one; an invariant does not.

The rule is: whatever a module declares in its own ``__all__`` is
importable from ``itacart`` and appears in ``itacart.__all__``. Nothing
here enumerates names, so a module that grows a public function is
covered the day it grows it.
