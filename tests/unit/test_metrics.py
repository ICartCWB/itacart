"""Shape metrics: the instrument first, then the grid.

Every number in this file was measured before it was written down. The
order of the file is the order of the argument: the compactness formula
is checked against shapes whose quotient is known in closed form, then
the projection it runs in is checked against the package's own areas,
and only then is a cell measured. A metric that disagrees with the grid
after all three have passed is evidence about the grid; one that has not
passed them is evidence about nothing.

Two claims here are negative -- that no cell scores above 1, and that
only the polar caps are refused -- and each ships with the control that
sees it fail, because a predicate nobody has watched fail is a predicate
nobody knows measures anything.
