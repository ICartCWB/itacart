"""The existence contract, censused rather than listed.

``is_valid_cell`` is the arbiter of whether a cell exists. Until this
module it was an arbiter nobody consulted: forty-six public callables
accepted a spelling it denies, thirteen answered about the neighbouring
cell because the western zero column folds onto its eastern twin, and one
handed that denied spelling back inside a cell list.

Two counts existed for that population and neither could be checked. One
phase measured forty-two, a later probe measured forty-six, and the two
did not contradict each other -- they measured different populations and
neither left an instrument behind. So the number this module reports comes
from a census that is mechanical over ``itacart.__all__`` and versioned
here, and the completeness of that census is itself an assertion: a name
added to the package lands in a bucket or in a named exemption, and there
is no third outcome.

The exemptions are assertions too, in the shape the totality module
established. A name excused from the refusing family has to demonstrate
that it belongs where it was put, so an exemption cannot rot into a
licence for a function that has quietly changed behaviour.
