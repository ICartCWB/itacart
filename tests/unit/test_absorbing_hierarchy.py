"""The parent-to-child contract on cells that absorb the domain border.

The contract is one sentence: the effective rings of the children cover
the effective ring of the parent, and their interiors do not overlap.
``boundary.plane_ring`` is the authority for "effective" -- it answers
after the pole and after absorption -- and every claim here is measured
against it rather than against the nominal lattice.

Why the nominal lattice is not enough is itself measured, in
:func:`test_the_nominal_footprint_does_not_cover_an_absorbing_parent`.
On the polar cap it covers 78.77% of the parent, and the shortfall does
not shrink with depth, because the absorbed surface is annexed at one
level and dropped by the next descent. Anything that enumerates children
by descending the footprint loses that surface permanently.

Three parents carry the regression. ``A5`` and ``E1`` are the two
trapezoids of the cap's first sub-row, mirror images of one another.
``B2`` is the polar triangle, whose effective ring is 2.93 times its
nominal one and which is therefore the hardest case in the grid.

    A child of a border-absorbing cell reaches past its parent. Not by an

    every quadrant, all 572 parents are affected and exactly two children
    of each leave, which is the two trapezoids. The share of a child's own
    area that falls outside runs to a median of 0.0381%, a mean of
    0.0569%, a ninetieth percentile of 0.1041% and a worst case of 2.4110%

    The cause is a chord, not a staircase. ``_x_border`` does not depend
    on the lattice row at all -- measuring that is what killed the first
    explanation. The border is a smooth convex curve on the plane, and an
    absorbing cell replaces its outer side by the chord of that curve
    across its own height. A parent spans one cell height and takes one
    chord; its children span half that each and take two, and a chord of a
    convex curve over a shorter span lies further out.

    The model is exact, which is what
    :func:`test_the_excess_is_the_chord_model_to_four_places` asserts: the
    excess area equals the sagitta times half the parent's height, to four
    decimal places, over parents whose sagitta runs from 0.95 to 6.12
    metres.

    None of this is the enumeration's doing. The child rings are what
    ``plane_ring`` returns and the child set is the one the contract
    proves. This is pinned, not asserted away: when the absorbing side
    stops being a per-cell chord, these numbers go to zero and this test
