"""Unit tests for :mod:`itacart.cells`.

Covers acceptance criteria 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 9 of F3.

Two measurement notes, both learned the hard way while writing these.

**Areas are measured locally.** The shoelace of a resolution-13 ring in
absolute plane coordinates is pure cancellation: the coordinates are
around 1e7 m and the side is 0.01 m, so the products are around 1e14 and
the answer around 1e-4. Every ring is therefore shifted to its own anchor
before its area is taken. Measuring wrong here would have looked exactly
like a broken cell.

**Orientation is measured on the plane, not on lon/lat.** The plane is
where the cell is a true parallelogram; the sign of the geodetic shoelace
happens to agree for small cells but that is a coincidence of scale, not
a property.
